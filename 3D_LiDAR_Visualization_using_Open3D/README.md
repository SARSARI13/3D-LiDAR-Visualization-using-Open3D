# 3D LiDAR Visualization using Open3D

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of visualizing 3D point clouds generated from 2D depth frames of the KITTI dataset using Open3D. The goal is to provide an interactive visualization of the environment captured by a Velodyne HDL-64E S2 LiDAR sensor.



## Description of the 2D KITTI Depth Frames Dataset
The KITTI dataset is a cornerstone in self-driving car research, offering a diverse array of data collected from onboard sensors including cameras and LiDAR. It encompasses real-world scenarios captured during vehicle operations in urban environments. Specifically, the dataset includes 2D depth frames derived from the Velodyne LiDAR sensor, providing precise distance measurements for objects within the sensor's field of view.

### Requirements

- **Python:** The script has been developed and tested with Python 3.8.2.
- **Libraries:** The following libraries are required:
  - numpy 1.24.4
  - time
  - os 
  - open3d
  - matplotlib
